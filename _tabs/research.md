# Master main subject

**Design of a novel Parallel robot**

**Principal objectives of the work :**

- Maximize the **Dexterity** Generate continuous rotations
- Create a **Redundancy parallel robot**
- **Increase the Stiffness of the robot** 
- Optimize the geometrical parameters of the robots

Theoretical Part developed in progress of publication, finishing the 3D design model in order to advance and create the firs physical prototype.

Research was conducted by Benjamin Mauz√© during his PhD and showed the nanometric resolutions of the robot with a centimetric range.



## Design and Optimization of a Delta Robot

### General Design

Force sensing using compliant structures to link linearly the displacement and the force is particularly interesting, especially when combined with the high resolution allowed by periodic patterns pose sensing.

This method of highly resolute force sensing has notably been studied by Guelpa to provide a sensor with a range of 50 mN with a resolution of 5 nM.

### Optimization of the materials

More recently, Bhwanath Tiwari extended the degrees of freedom of force - displacement sensors by creating a compliant structure with embedding a **large range periodic pattern** to measure 3 DoF forces and torque with a nano-Newton resolution.

# Trading with Reinforcenment learning


## Performances

This method was tested through both simulations and experimentations and **performances of pose measurement resolutions** can be summarized as follow:

| Axis     | Resolution    | Range of measure |
| -------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| $x$      | 1 nm          | 11.6 cm          |
| $y$      | 1 nm          | 11.6 cm          |
| $z$      | < 0.1 mm      | /                |
| $\alpha$ | 4.1 $\mu$rad. | $2\pi$ rad.      |
| $\beta$  | 120 $\mu$rad. | $\pi/8$ rad.     |
| $\gamma$ | 118 $\mu$rad. | $\pi/8$ rad.     |
